# Future improvement - allow the installed system to boot into the installer
#

# TODO
# - if there is enough RAM
# - and probably if not disabled by config
# - and if the boot media is still around
# - search for the boot media and mount it
# - extract the kernel and initramfs
# - place these somewhere well known

# as part of the inchroot scripts
# - if the kernel and initramfs are somewhere well known
# - copy them into the right place on the EFS boot partition
# - create a nsh script to allow booting into the rescue system
